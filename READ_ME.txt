Purpose: Order database for Grubstake

How to use: enter orders, backend keeps track of all the data. Query for day or cabin-specific searches

How certain things work:
supplies are reused for different meals in a single order.
  e.g. if you order quesadillas and pancakes, you only need one stove
ingredients are combined together for each meal
  e.g. if you order quesadillas and breakfast burritos, you'll get twice as many tortillas as someone who is only getting quesadillas
each meal gives an estimated serving size for the quantity of items it lists.
these serving sizes are then divided by the number of people in the order, rounding up,
to determine the amount of food to serve


THINGS TO DO IN THE FUTURE
multipliers for different units
options *****
GUI *****
differentiate breakfast, dinner, misc.
make order input mechanical from text file
make times 15 minute intervals/more times
allow pickups a different session
